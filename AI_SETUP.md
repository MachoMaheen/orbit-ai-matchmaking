## Testing the AI Features

### 1. Essay Analyzer

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/essay-analyzer`

**Test Essay:**
```
The moment I realized I wanted to pursue business was when I led my first team project at my internship. Managing five engineers across different time zones taught me the importance of clear communication and strategic planning. We successfully delivered the project two weeks ahead of schedule, which resulted in a 30% increase in client satisfaction scores.

This experience showed me that I thrive in environments where I can combine technical knowledge with leadership skills. An MBA from your institution would provide me with the frameworks and network to scale this impact globally.
