# ðŸ”§ Suspense Boundary Fix

## Problem
The `useUser()` hook in the Navigation component was causing a "NoSuspenseBoundaryError" because it needs a Suspense boundary to handle the async user loading state.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Navigation Component
Changed:
```tsx
const user = useUser();
```

To:
```tsx
const user = useUser({ or: null });
```

This tells Stack Auth to return `null` while loading instead of throwing, which prevents the Suspense error.

### 2. Added Suspense Boundary in Layout
Wrapped the Navigation component with a Suspense boundary:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<NavigationSkeleton />}>
    <Navigation />
</Suspense>
```

### 3. Created Loading Skeleton
Added a `NavigationSkeleton` component that shows:
- Animated logo placeholder
- Animated text placeholder
- Animated button placeholder
- Smooth loading experience

## Benefits

âœ… **No more errors** - Proper Suspense handling
âœ… **Better UX** - Smooth loading states
âœ… **Professional** - Skeleton screens are industry standard
âœ… **Fast** - No blocking while loading user data

## How It Works

```
Page Load
    â†“
Layout renders
    â†“
Suspense boundary shows skeleton
    â†“
Navigation loads user data
    â†“
User data ready
    â†“
Navigation renders with actual data
    â†“
Skeleton replaced with real navigation
```

## Testing

1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. You should briefly see the skeleton
3. Then the real navigation appears
4. No errors in console

## Files Changed

- âœ… `components/navigation.tsx` - Changed `useUser()` call
- âœ… `app/layout.tsx` - Added Suspense boundary and skeleton
